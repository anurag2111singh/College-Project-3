# Automatic Soil Moisture Detection and Plant Watering System using IOT
It is an Arduino based automatic plant watering system that uses a Soil
Moisture Sensor. The Automatic Irrigation System with Arduino works by using a moisture
sensor to detect the moisture level in the soil. The Arduino Uno microcontroller is
programmed to read the sensor's values and activate a water pump when the moisture falls
below a predetermined threshold. In this project, we employ the use of a Moisture sensor to
monitor and maintain the optimal moisture levels for your plants. With this automated
system, you can bid farewell to worries about plant survival during your absence. It's equally
suitable for both outdoor gardens and indoor plants, allowing you to care for your leafy
companions wherever they may be.
